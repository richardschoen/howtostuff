# Instructions to successfully build ILEAstic from GitHub
It appears there is an issue building the ILEAstic and NOXDB applications from the initial git close using an SSH terminal.

However the build process does seem to work via a QShell terminal.  Not sure wht but it works.   

The open project issue is: Install gmake issue #153

## The issue with building from an SSH terminal
- Before trying to QSH install I tried building via a bash session via an SSH terminal.  I made sure that the ```/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin``` open source packages were in my search path. However when I tried the build steps as listed on the readme.md page from SSH, the build failed based on same error as issue #53 above.

- Based on the issue, what I learned from the #53 issue  is that I could build the ILEASTIC and NOXDB app libraries from the green screen using the QShell terminal interface.   
  ‚ùóI'm not sure why this works from QShell and not SSH, but it does build.  

## Clone and build steps from a 5250 session for building ILEASTIC
- First review the readme.md on the ILEAstic site for build prerequisite requirements: https://github.com/sitemule/ILEastic   

- Sign on to a 5250 command line session with a user that has permissions to build code.

- Set the multi-threaded env variable **before starting/entering the QShell terminal**.    
```
ADDENVVAR ENVVAR('QIBM_MULTI_THREADED') VALUE('Y') CCSID(*JOB) LEVEL(*JOB) REPLACE(*YES)
```

- Start QShell terminal via ```STRQSH``` command.

- Set your path with following export statement from within QSH terminal:
```
export PATH=/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin:$PATH
```

- Run the following commands from the QSH terminal to clone and build the project. Same steps as the ILEAstic site uses.
```
mkdir /prj
cd /prj 
git -c http.sslVerify=false clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sitemule/ILEastic.git
cd ILEastic
gmake  
```

- If all works as expected, the ILEASTIC library should exist with the following list of objects (```WRKOBJPDM ILEASTIC```):

Now that the ILEASTIC and NOXDB libraies exist you are ready to start building HTTP server apps with ILEastic.
